# 📒 Notes Manager (Java File I/O)
## 📌 Overview
This is a simple text-based **Notes Manager** built in Java.  
It allows you to **✍️ add notes** and **view saved notes** directly from the console.  
All notes are stored in a text file (`notes.txt`) using **📂 FileReader** and **🖊️ FileWriter**, so your notes persist between runs.
## 🤔 Why I Built This
I created this project to practice and demonstrate:
- 🗂️ Basic **Java File I/O** operations (reading and writing files).
- 💻 Building a **console-based application** with a simple menu system.
- 🛡️ Handling **exceptions** and ensuring files are created/used correctly.
## ⭐ Key Concepts
- 🖊️ **FileWriter** → for saving notes (append mode).  
- 📂 **FileReader / BufferedReader** → for reading saved notes.  
- ⚠️ **Exception Handling** → catching `IOException` and `FileNotFoundException`.  
- ⌨️ **Console Interaction** → using `Scanner` for user input.  
- 💾 **Persistence** → notes are stored permanently in `notes.txt`.
## 🛠️ Technical Skills Practiced
- ☕ Java programming fundamentals
- 📄 File handling (`FileReader`, `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`)
- 🛡️ Exception handling (`try-with-resources`)
- 💻 Command-line input/output
- 📝 Project structure and documentation (`README.md`)
